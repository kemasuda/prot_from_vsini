# prot_from_vsini
rotation period distribution from vsini and radius



#### scripts for main analysis

- period_posterior.py

  compute marginal likelihood for prot and save results 

- run_hierarchical.py

  run the main hierarchical analysis to infer prot distribution

- plot_results.py

  plot results

- split_samples.py

  split samples based on Teff etc.



#### scripts for injection recovery tests

- simulate_samples.py

  simulate mock catalogs of radii and vsini for a given prot distribution

- run_hierarchical_MC.py, plot_results_MC.py

  run hierarchical analyses for random subsets of the simulated samples and check how much the results fluctuate depending on the sample size
